Contributing to DWV
===================

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to WAL,
which is hosted at https://github.com/ivmartel/wal on GitHub.

Steps
-----
If something is not right, the first step is to submit an issue with as much detail
about your problem and your configuration. This is to make sure this behaviour is not
intended (a 'feature').

The second step, for the braves, is to fork the repository and work on a fix. Don't hesitate
to ask for help, I am here for that! Once finished, you can propose a pull request. I will review
it, make comments and hopefully merge it.
